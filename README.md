# Anomaly-Detection

Anomaly/Fraud Detection using k-means to cluster data points.  
When a new data point comes, its distance is measured to
its nearest centroid. If this distance exceeds some
threshold, it is anomalous.
				
Dataset Type:  Networks connections for IDS.  
Data Source:  http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html

              
Status:  Work in progress.  Codes not optimized, just experimenting!
